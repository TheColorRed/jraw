jraw-0.0.1-alpha
================

jraw (Draw with a "j" instead of a "d") is a JavaScript Library that uses the canvas to manipulate image layers.

Currently Supported
-------------------

###Adjustments###
- Brightness
- Contrast
- Hue
- Saturation

###Things To Change (TODO)###
- Needs to be able to create and adjust layers individually. jraw should be the main class which can initiate a layer class. The layer class will then allow for image manipulation just on that layer.
- Add more Adjustments
- Add filters
- Add blending modes
