#jraw-0.0.1-alpha#

jraw (Draw with a "j" instead of a "d") is a JavaScript Library that uses the canvas to manipulate image layers.

##Currently Supported##

###Adjustments###
- Brightness
- Contrast
- Hue
- Saturation

##Things To Change (TODO)##
- Needs to be able to create and adjust layers individually. jraw should be the main class which can initiate a layer class. The layer class will then allow for image manipulation just on that layer.
