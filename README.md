#jraw-0.0.1-alpha#

jraw (Draw with a "j" instead of a "d") is a JavaScript Library that uses a JavaScript Canvas for each layer to manipulate images in memory and display them on one main canvas on the page. 

You can attach inputs such as text fields or range sliders to an action like Brightness or Contrast.

##Currently Supported##

###Adjustments###
- Brightness
- Contrast
- Hue
- Saturation

##Things To Change (TODO)##
- ~~Needs to be able to create and adjust layers individually. jraw should be the main class which can initiate a layer class. The layer class will then allow for image manipulation just on that layer.~~
